Direct updating of breeding values</H3>
The breeding value can be based on own and fathers and mothers record,
as well as average of offspring of the three animals. Offspring of parents
o the animal are either full or half sibs.

<P>In the lower section can be produced a graph
which shows the joint accuracy depending
on number of own offspring.

<P><B>In all cells with initial values you can put data (green and/o yellow
fields)</B>
<hr>
<p><b>An example and description are shown in the this section.</b>
<P>The applet is shown as a figure below with a pedigree diagram showing
the relations between the animals in the applet. Some explanations of how
to run the applet are given below the figure.

<P><B>Description of the buttons and fields</B>
<LI>
To start use the <B>Initiate</B> button (it works only one time), where
it puts 0 o any default value.</LI>

<LI>
When you have put your data click the <B>Calculate</B> button and you get
your results.</LI>

<LI>
The breeding values should be <B>Nullified</B> before you make new calculations.</LI>

<B>Parameters</B>
<LI>
Mean value fo the traits (actual 100)</LI>

<LI>
Heritability fo the traits (actual 20 %)</LI>

<LI>
Common Milieu (environment) fo the traits for full sibs (actual 5
%)</LI>

<LI>
Repeatability fo the traits, for repeated measurements (actual 30)</LI>

<LI>
Offspring text default is <B>offspring.half</B> fo half sibs. If you
want full sibs put <B>offspring.full</B></LI>


<P>The <B>number and value (average) fo the six posible observations</B>
<LI>
Father, ---- BV fo F on own records (actual 1 record, value 110)</LI>

<LI>
F offspring, BV fo F on offspring records (actual 10 records, value 105,
offspring.full is set)</LI>

<LI>
Mother, ---- BV fo M on own records</LI>

<LI>
M offspring, BV fo M on offspring records</LI>

<LI>
Own, ----- BV fo O on own records (actual 1 record, value 99)</LI>

<LI>
O offspring, BV fo O on offspring records</LI>

<H4>
Results of calculation</H4>
The <B>breeding value and accuracy fo the six observations</B>
<LI>
Father, ---- BV fo F on own records (actual based on 1 record, value 110)</LI>

<LI>
F offspring, BV fo F on offspring records (actual based on 10 records,
value 105, offspring.full is set)</LI>

<LI>
Mother, ---- BV fo M on own records</LI>

<LI>
M offspring, BV fo M on offspring records</LI>

<LI>
Own, ----- BV fo O on own records (actual based on 1 record, value 99)</LI>

<LI>
O offspring, BV fo O on offspring records</LI>


<P>The <B>breeding values and accuracy**2 in the last two lines</B>
<LI>
Father, ---- BV fo F on own and offspring records (actual based on own
record and 10 offspring)</LI>

<LI>
Mother, ---- BV fo M on own and offspring records</LI>

<LI>
Own, ---- BV fo O on own and offspring records (actual based on 1 record)</LI>

<LI>
Own, ---- BV fo O on both parents and their offspring (actual based on
all fathers information)</LI>

<LI>
Own, ---- BV fo O on all available information (actual based on own and
all fathers information)</LI>

<H4>
Special facility</H4>
The Father and mother text default is <B>own.new</B> If you want to use
old BV estimates and accuracies**2 fo father and/or mother use <B>own.old</B>
and in the same line put the old values fo BV and accuracy**2. In these
cases the offspring lines is not used.
