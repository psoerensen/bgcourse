<H3>5.7 Field data, statistical tests </H3>

<P><A HREF="6.htm">Preceding page</A> </P>

<P>When the use of field data is needed, and it concerns newly occurred diseases,
only families with affected offspring can be considered. When a segregation ratio for Mendelian inheritance
is calculated on the base of such observations, it is necessary to correct for
families that due to random chances are not segregating.


<P><TABLE ALIGN="RIGHT" >
<TR><TD>Figure 5.7
<br>Theoretical segregation of heterozygotic 
<br>parents
 in 7 out of 16 families of two. 
<br><img src="../../genetik/5/72.gif" ></TD></TR></TABLE>

If recessive inheritance occurs and both parents in a family are
heterozygotes
the chance of the family not being detected, by means of an affected first born,
is 3/4. After the birth of&nbsp; the second offspring the chances will be (3/4)<SUP>2</SUP> = 9/16.
Figure 5.7 shows how heterozygotic parents will segregate in a family of two. 9
out of 16 families will have no affected offspring, so by excluding these families
in the final analysis, the classical Mendelian analysis becomes meaningless.</P>

<P>In the following are formulas for testing and calculating&nbsp; the corrected segregation in families
which have chances of
segregation. Therefore the relevant data (shaded area) from Figure 5.7 is:</P>
<PRE>
T = 14   -total number
A = 8   -number of affected
A<SUB>1</SUB> = 6   -number of families with 1 affected
A<SUB>2</SUB> = 1   -number of families with 2 affected
</PRE>

<P>Figure 5.8 shows a path diagram of a mink family from a farm with an outbreak of tyrosinaemia. One of the
clinical symptoms is, as shown in the picture, the fact that the eyelids stick together. The whelps die after one
or two days
with clinical symptoms. The cases occur when the whelp is about six weeks. A description of the disease can be found in
Christensen et al. <i> Canadian J. Comparative Medicine</i>, 43:333-340, 1979.</P>

on the right shows an affected
whelp with the typical sticky eyelids.<BR>

<P>The formulas to apply according to "Singles method" for a test of Mendelian inheritance (for the
proportion p-hat) are shown below. The actual numbers from the tyrosinaemia case, Figure 5.8, are inserted.<BR>
<p align=center><img src="../../genetik/5/71.gif"  >
</P>

<P>T and A are respectively the total number of offspring and the number of affected offspring. A<SUB>1</SUB> and A<SUB>2</SUB> are
the number of
families with respectively 1 and 2 affected offspring. Z<SUP>2</SUP> is Chi-squared distributed with 1 degree of
freedom. P-hat is tested against the expected segregation frequency (p) which in the tyrosinaemia case is 0.25, as
it is expected
that both parents are carriers. </P>

<P>In the mink family is found that:</P>
<PRE>
T = 94   -total number
A = 32   -number of affected
A<SUB>1</SUB> = 4   -number of families with 1 affected
A<SUB>2</SUB> = 9   -number of families with 2 affected
</PRE>

<P>The calculation is carried out by inserting the actual numbers in the formulas above. There is no significant statistical
deviation from a 3:1 segregation ratio as the test value is less than 3,84 (H<SUB>0</SUB>: p(hat) = p =0,25). Families with more
than 2 affected individuals are not directly part of the calculations, but contribute only to the total number of affected.<BR>
An applet for the calculation can be found <A HREF="../../genetik/applets/single.htm">here</A> </P>

<P>If the number from the first theoretical example (Figure 5.7) is inserted in the formula for
p(hat) we get (8-6)/(14-6) =
0.25, which is of course the correct result, as the data originated from mating
with known heterozygotes.</P>
