<H3>5.4 Sex-linked recessive inheritance</H3>

<P><A HREF="3.htm">Preceding page</A> </P>

<P>Sex-linked inheritance works differently in mammals than in birds. In mammals
the sex-chromosomes are called XX and XY in female and male, respectively. In the
birds the female is the hetero gametic, WZ, and the male is homo gametic, ZZ. The
sex of the offspring is determined by the hetero gametic sex, in birds by the
female and in mammals by the male.</P>

<P><STRONG>Factors indicating sex-linked recessive inheritance.</STRONG> </P>

<UL>
  <LI>1. Affected females are often inbred</LI>
  <LI>2. Affected individuals do not necessarily occur in every generation</LI>
  <LI>3. Offspring of two affected parents are also affected</LI>
  <LI>4. In offspring of normal parents, only males can be affected </LI>
  <LI>5. The population frequency in males is higher than in females</LI>
