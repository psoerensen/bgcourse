<P><STRONG>Factors which indicate autosomal recessive inheritance.</STRONG> </P>

<UL>
  <LI>1. The individuals which are affected are often inbred</LI>
  <LI>2. Affected individuals do not necessarily occurring in every generation</LI>
  <LI>3. All offspring with both parents affected are also affected </LI>
  <LI>4. The population frequency in males and females are the same </LI>
  <LI>5. The segregation is 1:3 in offspring of normal parents</LI>

<P>Figure 5.2 shows an example of autosomal recessive inheritance. <BR>
Genes, which coded for enzymes, are typical example of recessive inheritance,
since one normal gene is often sufficient for the individual to function
normally. Increased transcription rate can compensate for the one defect code.
