<H3>5.6 Test mating, statistical tests</H3>

<P><A HREF="5.htm">Preceding page</A> </P>

<P>When a smaller material is pointing at Mendelian segregation, there would
often be alternative hypotheses,
which cannot be excluded. The segregation can, as mentioned earlier, also be
caused by simulated genetics (phenocopies)
or threshold inheritance, where the segregation can resemble simple Mendelian inheritance.
If a given hypothesis is to be accepted, test mating is in many cases simply waiting for more offspring
to be born, in which the results are predictable. If the results deviate, a new
hypothesis, which can be tested, has to be formulated.</P>

<P><STRONG>How much data material is needed for a given test to give a final
answer?</STRONG> </P>

<P>This is one of the important questions that have to be answered before the
initiation of test mating. </P>

<P>Test mating of a bull, which is a suspected carrier, can be done by mating the bull with
known affected cows, known carriers or the bull's own daughters.
Taking these cases into consideration, how many normal offspring does the bull
have to produce before he can
be declared unaffected? The probability that one normal offspring is born in the three cases is
respectively 1/2, 3/4
and 7/8. By applicating the multiplication rule for probabilities in mating with known
carriers, the probability of getting one normal offspring is (3/4)<SUP>n</SUP>. By means of this formula and a
limit of significance of 0.05, 0.01 and 0.001 n can be determined to meet the classic probability criteria.</P>

a bull as carrier</STRONG> </P>

Theoretical segregation of recessive genes in test mating with own daughters. 
 <br><img src="../../genetik/5/fdatter.gif" ></TD></TR></TABLE>

<P>For normal offspring of a heterozygotic individual by father/daughters
mating the probability is 7/8, as can be derived
from Figure 5.6. The number of offspring needed to declare the father non-carrier on the 5% level is
(7/8)<SUP>n</SUP> = 0,05 corresponding to n*ln(7/8) = ln(0,05), which rounded is n=23.<P>Mating with own
daughters also has the advantage that the bull is tested as carrier of all
possible recessive genes, not only the one he is suspected of having.</P>

<P><STRONG>Chi-square tests </STRONG></P>

<P>By testing for segregation ratios for known mating a Chi-square test can be utilized. The
test
for mating with known
carriers resembles the test for H-W equilibrium, but here the expected numbers are
in the ratios 1:2:1 for co-dominant and 3:1 for dominant cases. The expected numbers are calculated by multiplying the expected frequencies
(ratios) with N, as shown in the table below.</P>

<PRE>---------
Genotype          AA               Aa             aa       Total
Numbers, obs      30               51             39      = 120 = N
Frequency, exp   1/4              1/2            1/4     = 1,00
Numbers, exp      30               60              30     = 120

</PRE>

<P>Df = 3-1 = 2, since the material only supplies the parameter N to the calculation of expected numbers. The Chi-square
value is less than the H<SUB>0</SUB> test value of 5.99, which means that there is no
statistical significant deviation from a 1:2:1
segregating on the 5% level.</P>

<P><STRONG> Segregation by test mating of Aa x Aa, dominant inheritance</STRONG> </P>
<PRE>---------
Genotype        AA+ Aa         aa       Total

Frequency, exp   3/4            1/4     = 1,00
Numbers, exp      90             30      = 120

Chi-squared     1.00            2.70    = 3.70
----------
</PRE>

<P>Df = 2-1 = 1, since the material only supplies the parameter N to the calculation of expected numbers. The Chi-square
value is just below the H<SUB>0</SUB> test value of 3.84, which means
 that there is no statistical significant
 deviation from a 3:1
segregation on the 5% level.</P>
