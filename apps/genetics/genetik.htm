<H3>Introduction</H3>

<P>The present genetics notes are produced as a substitute for '<i>Veterinary
Genetics</i>' by FW.Nicolas, Oxford University Press, 1989. This book was not available
after 1995.</P>

<P>The notes are produced for a course for veterinary students. Therefore,
 efforts have been made to adjust the notes for students with a 
biological background, 
and at the same time  supply a minimal set of formulas to describe the 
relationship between practical observations and genetic theory. In
addition to the description of traits with simple Mendelian inheritance, the
description of the genetics for traits (diseases) with
multifactoriel aetiology has also been emphasized, here the application of correct breeding plans
make it possible to&nbsp; significantly lower the frequency of the disease.</P>

<P>The genetics notes are available on the  www server, which can be
reached from the address: www.ihh.kvl.dk/htm/kc/popgen/genetics/genetik.htm. Both an English and a
Danish version is available. The online voice version includes a slide show
with more than 350 slides. The voice in the voice version belongs to Anne Asp Poulsen
who study English at the Copenhagen University, she also gave comments on the English style
in the text and figures. </P>

<P>The online notes include a number of links (underlined in the text) to other servers and to extended calculation examples and data
programs (applets). </P>

<P>There is no independent exercise section yet in the English version. But to
each applet there is an example and one or more exercises for solution.</P>

<P>Ass. professor <A HREF="//www.dina.kvl.dk/~sestoft/">Peter Sestoft</A>  
  has advised me while producing the applets.</P>

<P>  Some students which had the important background of being in the process of learning the
topic have commented on the text. Any proposals for additional improvements
  are welcome.</P>
