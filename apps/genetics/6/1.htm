<H3>6.1 Definition of a quantitative trait </H3>

<P><A HREF="0.htm">Chapter 6</A> </P>

<P>In section 1.4 was given a definition of the terms phenotype and 
genotype for a quantitative trait,
this
equation is shown below. Until now the terms have only applied to qualitative traits.
<BR><br>

<P>The phenotype can be seen or measured, in contrast to the genotype which can be transferred to
offspring.<BR>
In chapter 1 the distribution of fat-% in the milk in two Danish
dairy breeds was given as an example of a quantitative trait. </P>

<P>The distribution of fat-% in the milk is characterized by a mean value 
and a standard deviation. For HF dairy breed the
mean value is 4.3 % and the standard deviation is 0.25 % units. Most cows have a fat-%
of around 4.3, and only very few have a fat-% of 3.5 or 5.0. For the Jersey breeds the mean fat-% is 6.4.<BR>
The phenotype of an animal should always be evaluated as being a deviation from the mean value of the population. For
instance a Jersey cow should be evaluated based on the mean value of the Jersey and not on the mean value of HF.</P>

<P><STRONG>Quantitative traits</STRONG> are normally influenced by the effects of
several gene pairs and the environment, and have a normal
distribution of population values. This is <STRONG>polygenic</STRONG> 
inheritance, as opposed to single gene (monogenic)
inheritance or Mendelian genetics, which have been described in the preceding
chapters.</P>
