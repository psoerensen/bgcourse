<H3>6.2 The terms genotype value, breeding value and dominance deviation</H3>

<P><A HREF="1.htm">Preceding page</A> </P>

<P>The phenotype value (P) of an animal can be measured and evaluated as a deviation from
the mean value of the population, P-bar. </P>

<P>The genotype value (G) of an animal equals the phenotype mean value of individuals with the same genotype. 
<TABLE ALIGN="RIGHT" BORDER="0" >
<TR VALIGN="TOP"><TD>Figure 6.1<BR>
The definition of breeding <BR>
value (A) of a male is based <BR>
on an infinite number of offspring,<BR>
all being half sibs. </TD>
<TD VALIGN="MIDDLE"><img src="../../genetik/6/23.gif"  align=bottom ></TD></TR></TABLE>

<P>The definition of the breeding value (A) of an individual is based on an
infinite number of offspring as two times the deviation of the
offspring's mean value from the mean value of the population, when random mating
is used. I.e. all offspring are
half sibs, see Figure 6.1.</P>

<P>The mean value of the population can be added if the breeding values should
be on a normal scale. The definition is valid
when it concerns both a specific trait, and the effect of genes on a single locus. The formulas corresponding to the definitions applied on data from a single locus are shown in Figure 6.2.
It is a precondition that the locus has an
effect on the examined trait and that the average of the animals (with
different genotypes) differs from each other.
The average of the population can be calculated as a mean value. I.e. the sum of the three genotypes multiplied by their
respective frequencies. See the example of weight of mice shown in Figure 6.2.

<TR VALIGN="TOP"><TD>Figure 6.2.<BR>
Definition of breeding value for the genotype A<SUB>1</SUB>A<SUB>1</SUB> and it is  
exemplified by weight of mice depending on the genotypes in a locus. A male with the genotype A<SUB>1</SUB>A<SUB>1</SUB> gets
    an infinite number of offspring after random mating in a population.</TD>
<TR><TD ALIGN="center"><img src="../../genetik/6/2.gif" ></TD></TR></TABLE>

<P>When an animal A<SUB>1</SUB>A<SUB>1</SUB> is subjected to random mating in a population,
the animal can get two types of offspring, A<SUB>1</SUB>A<SUB>1</SUB> and A<SUB>1</SUB>A<SUB>2,</SUB> as
seen in
Figure 6.2. The gene from the population determined the genotype in the offspring.
 The frequencies of the two
possible genotypes are equal to the population frequencies p and q. </P>

<P>The mean value of a population or of A<SUB>1</SUB>A<SUB>1</SUB>'s offspring
is calculated as: </P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><img src="../../genetik/6/21.gif" width="350" height="66" align=bottom > </P>

<P>In the example of the weight of mice ( Figure 6.2), calculation of the mean value
of the population (P bar) and breeding
value for the genotype A<SUB>1</SUB>A<SUB>1</SUB> is shown. A similar breeding value can be calculated for genotype A<SUB>2</SUB>A<SUB>2</SUB>,
which, by random mating
in the population, gets offspring of the types A<SUB>1</SUB>A<SUB>2</SUB> and A<SUB>2</SUB>A<SUB>2</SUB> with the frequencies p and q.
These results are derived from Figure 6.2 by mating the population with A<SUB>2</SUB>A<SUB>2</SUB>
instead of A<SUB>1</SUB>A<SUB>1</SUB>. Thus the breeding value of A<SUB>2</SUB>A<SUB>2</SUB> is 2(12*0.3+6*0.7 - 9,24) = -4,88. </P>

<P>The breeding values of the heterozygotes is the average of the two pure genotypes, as half of its gametes is
type A<SUB>1</SUB> and the other half is type A<SUB>2</SUB>. The breeding values
are often called the additive values, because they are proportional to the number of A<SUB>1</SUB> genes in the genotype.</P>

<P>If the genotype value (G) has a more or less distinct dominance, 
the average value of a specific
genotype is not equal to the breeding value (A). But there will be a
rest which is caused by dominance deviations (D). <BR>
The degree of dominance is determined by the value of the heterozygote type
compared to the two homozygote
types:<BR>
</P>

<UL>
  <LI>No dominance - the heterozygote is equal to the average of the two homozygotes </LI>
  <LI>Complete dominance - the heterozygote has the same genotype value as one of the homozygotes</LI>
  <LI>Overdominance - the heterozygote is out side the homozygotes</LI>
</UL>

<P><STRONG>An example of calculation of breeding value (A) and dominance deviations (D) </STRONG> <BR>
Below is the results of an example of variation in transferrin locus. In Jersey cows
the genotype tt
yield 2082 kg. milk and cows with the genotypes Tt and TT yields 1882 kg. milk.
Below are the actual numbers, the calculation of the mean value is based on the gene
frequencies p and q, which are respectively 0.67 and 0.33.</P>

And mean value   = 0.45*1882 + 0.44*1882 + 0.11*2082 = 1904 kg

<P>The breeding values are calculated as deviations from the mean values of the population, see

tt         2*[(-22*0.67 + 178*0.33) - 0] = 89.2  
--------------------------------------------------</PRE>

<P>By random mating in the population the genotype TT gets offspring which are
of types TT and Tt with the frequencies p
and q. This can be derived from Figure 6.2.</P>

<P> The genotype values are determined as deviations from the population mean (see scale). And the breeding values are
calculated according to the definition. Finally the dominance deviations (D) can be determined as a rest as shown
below.</P>

TT          -22  =  -44    +  22
Tt          -22  =   22,6  + -44.6
tt          178  =   89,2  +  88.8

<P>It is possible to calculate the variance for a locus. The variance can be
caused by the differences in breeding values or in dominance
deviations. The variance (V) is calculated as a mean value of the squared breeding
values. For instance, the variance
of the breeding values: V<SUB>A</SUB> = 
(-44-0)<SUP>2</SUP>*0.45 + (22.6-0)<SUP>2</SUP>*0.44 + (89.2-0)<SUP>2</SUP>*0.11 = 1926,
 which, in this case, are
the breeding values squared and multiplied by the genotype frequency. The average of the breeding values can be
calculated as a mean value -44*0.45 + 22,6*0.44 + 89,2*0.11 = 0, which was to be expected.</P>

Experiments to determine quantitative gene effects are described in chapter 12. Loci,
which has effect on a quantitative trait, are often called QTL's (quantitative trait loci).</P>
