<H3>6.3 The terms additive variance and heritability </H3>

<P><A HREF="2.htm">Preceding page</A> </P>

<P>The term <STRONG>additive variance</STRONG>  refers to the variance of
 breeding values (V<SUB>A</SUB>). (In some of the next
chapters&nbsp; the symbol sigma<SUP>2</SUP>  is used synonymous with the
variance.) Section 6.2 showed how the breeding value for each genotype in a
locus could be estimated. When the genotype values are known, the additive variance for the
locus can also
be calculated. If independence occur between the loci, which have additive effect on a trait, then the
joint additive variance will be the sum of variances from each locus. For individuals in a
population the joint additive variance cannot be calculated
directly, since the breeding value of the individuals is not known. It is not possible
for all
individuals to have the infinite number of offspring, which are required when the definition
of breeding value is used.
But V<SUB>A</SUB> can be calculated indirectly, as shown later in this chapter.
</P>

<P>The <STRONG>phenotypic variance</STRONG> (V<SUB>P</SUB>), on the other hand, can always be calculated
using the phenotypic values of the individuals in
the population.</P>

<P>The <STRONG>heritability</STRONG> (h<SUP>2</SUP>) or the degree of heritability for a trait is defined as V<SUB>A</SUB>/V<SUB>P</SUB>. The heritability can vary between 0
and 1, since the additive variance is only part of the phenotypic variance. </P>

<P>Even though the additive variance cannot be directly estimated, the 
heritability can be estimated
on the basis of the similarity
between related individuals, which is measured either by  a correlation or a regression. 
For instance, the regression of offspring on one of the
parents.  The heritability is estimated as the ratio of the calculated correlation
coefficient and the coefficient of relationship. Which means that the 
maximum expected correlation between parent and offspring
is 0.5. If the correlation coefficient is higher, it means that the similarity
is caused by other factors besides the genetic.<P>The best method for estimating 
the heritability is
the use of the correlation between half sibs, since they normally&nbsp; have only
genes in common. Full sibs, on the other hand, often have a maternal environment in
common too, which causes the litter
mates to be even more alike, and have more in common than genes. In such cases the heritability would be overestimated.<BR>
The parent-offspring   correlation is seldom used in practise, since this method
needs data from two generations, often with different environment. It can also
be a problem if both parent and offspring live in the same environment. </P>

<P>Estimation of the variance component, caused by common environment for full
sibs, can be carried out by comparing the
estimated correlation based on respectively half and full sibs.
 The correlation between full sibs should be twice the one
for half sibs. Often it is higher, the reason for this is that the full sibs have a common environment. This component is assigned the
symbol c<SUP>2</SUP>, c for 'common environment'. The relative phenotypic variance
has a genetic part
(h<SUP>2</SUP>),  a common environmental part (c<SUP>2</SUP>), and a third part.
This remaining part of the variance is caused by random environmental
effects, and gets the symbol e<SUP>2</SUP>. The random environmental part is for
most traits the largest part of
the phenotypic variance. Below is shown a table of the defined  parameters. </P>

<P>Historically, the heritability has another interpretation. By selecting animals (shades area in
Figure 6.3), which deviate from the mean value, the average of the next generation will
change. The change is  proportional to the difference in selection and the heritability following the formula:</P>

<P>R = h<SUP>2</SUP>*S </P>

<P>The selection response (R) equals the heritability multiplied by the 
selection difference 
 (S). The heritability is 0, if the trait remains constant by selection, 
and it is 1, if the changes are equal to the selection difference, see
Figure 6.3. </P>
