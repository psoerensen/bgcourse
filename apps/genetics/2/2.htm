<H3>2.2 Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and statistical tests </H3>

<P><A HREF="1.htm">Preceding page</A> </P>

<P><STRONG>Definition of H-W equilibrium.</STRONG> In a large population with random mating H-W equilibrium will occur after one
generation provided that the same gene frequencies occur in both sexes. Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium implies that
gene and genotype frequencies are constant from generation to generation. If disequilibrium occurs, equilibrium will
be reestablished after one generation of random mating. The H-W conditions also
imply that when the gene frequencies
are p and q, the genotype frequencies will be respectively p<SUP>2</SUP>, 2pq and q<SUP>2</SUP> for the dominant, the heterozygotes and the recessive
in a two allele system. This can be inferred by the arguments given for the recessive type under dominant inheritance</P>

<P><STRONG>Statistical test for H-W equilibrium</STRONG> <BR>
Exemplified by data from the albumin types in Danish German Shepherd population, shown in section 2.1.<BR>
The following observed numbers of the three genotypes (obs), and the calculated
expected numbers under Hardy Weinberg equilibrium (exp) with frequencies p(S)=0.56 and
q(F)=0.44 was found in the population.</P>

---------- </PRE>

<P>The expected numbers for Hardy Weinberg equilibrium (exp) are calculated using the multiplication rule for probabilities.<BR>
For the SS genotype an S gene from a father and an S gene from a mother has to be
drawn, the same repeated 106
times. Therefore the probability for an SS genotype is&nbsp; p*p*106. The corresponding arguments for the&nbsp;
other two genotypes lead to the results shown in the table above.<BR>
Now a Chi-square test for H-W equilibrium can&nbsp;be calculated as the sum of squared deviations, each divided by the
expected number.<BR>
The test has 1 degree of freedom as there are three classes, and two free parameters given by
the material, p and N, has to be applied to calculate the expected numbers. The last used parameter (q) is not free, as it can be calculated
as (1 - p).<BR>
 By use of the chi-square table (chapter 13), with DF=1 the value 3,84 equals the 5% limits for maintaining the H<SUB>0</SUB> hypothesis,
that the data has H-W proportions. Therefore the found deviation between observed and expected numbers
has a probability which is larger than 5%. Conclusion: There is no statistical deviation from H-W equilibrium.</P>
