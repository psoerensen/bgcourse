<P><STRONG>Genetic terms concerning genes and alleles. </STRONG> <BR>
The Labrador Retriever race has the coat colour types yellow and black. Thus
considering a gene for yellow
coat colour, it points at both a locus and an allele. This corresponds to the early understanding of
genes where there was a variant (yellow) corresponding to the wild type (black). <BR>
The term 'gene' should not be used when talking about a DNA polymorphism&nbsp; with more
alleles in non-coding sequences. Instead the term 'locus' should be used. This terminology
also ought to be used in connexion with
genetic variants. There is not always a sharp separation between gene and locus,
and between gene and allele in practice.
So when gene frequencies are mentioned in this chapter, it would include genes in the traditional sense and alleles in
non-coding DNA sequences (loci). </P>

Figure 2.1.
Albumin type is codominantly inherited, which means that both
alleles can be seen directly on the gel. The phenotypes,
seen on the gel, are an SS, an SF and an FF albumin type.After the 
electrophoresis of the serum samples
the gel is stained with Amidoblack.

<P><STRONG>Gene counting method, Co-dominant inheritance, Phenotype = Genotype </STRONG> <BR>
Data from a study of albumin types in Danish German Shepherd will be used 
to explain the principles, see Table
1 section 2.4. When serum is tested on an electrophoresis gel there 
is a 'fast' and a 'slow' albumin allele designated as the F and S allele,
 respectively. The investigations 
have been carried out  by K. Christensen et al. 1985,
<i>Hereditas</i>, 102:219-223.

<P>The following numbers of the 3 albumin genotypes was found in a population.</P>
<PRE>---------
Genotype        SS          SF         FF     Total
Number          36          47         23      106
Frequency      0.34       0.44       0.22    = 1.00
----------</PRE>

<P>The frequency of the SS type is calculated as 36/106 = 0.34</P>

<P>The calculation of&nbsp; <STRONG>gene frequency</STRONG> for S is based on the gene counting method, every SS individuals have 2 S
genes and a SF individual has 1. This is relative to all genes in the population, which are 2*106.</P>
<PRE>The frequency of S is calculated as  p = (2*36 + 47)/(2*106) = 0.56
    do        F                do    q = (2*23 + 47)/(2*106) = 0.44
                                                              ------
                                                               1.00</PRE>

<P>The frequency of the first allele is normally given the symbol p and the second the symbol q. If there are
more
alleles the symbols are continued alphabetically.</P>

<P>An allele frequency corresponds to a probability, and therefore the sum of
alleles (gene frequencies) is 1. For <A HREF="../../genetik/applets/stat.htm">basic statistical formulations</A>, or Samuels,

<P><STRONG>Examples of multiple alleles (more than two alleles)</STRONG> <BR>
In section 1.5 the segregation of a mikrosatellite in a swine family was
mentioned. There are 3 alleles as can be seen in the gel in Figure 2.2. 
The allele designations are 209, 199 and 195<BR>

The boar Cup carries the alleles 209 and 195 and sow

are heterozygotes each with two bands. The homozygotes have only one band.

<BR>

<P>The calculations of the gene frequencies by means of the gene counting methods are shown below. For the allele <BLINK>'209'</BLINK>
there are 18 heterozygotes and 2 homozygotes (no bands in the lower line). <i>Count
for yourself!</i> For the allele '199' there are 12
heterozygotes and 0 homozygotes (all 12 have bands in '199' line plus one other band in either
'195' or '209').<i> Count again!</i></P>
<PRE>Frequency of '209' calculated as p = (2*2 + 18)/(2*44) = 0.250
 do            '199'    do       q = (2*0 + 12)/(2*44) = 0.134
 do            '195'    do       r = 1 - p - q         = 0.616 
</PRE>

<P>The last allele frequency is most easily calculated as a difference, since the sum of the allele frequencies is 1.<BR>

<P><A NAME="Dominant"></A><STRONG>The square root method, Dominant inheritance</STRONG> <BR>

<P>In a population of Labrador Retrievers the following numbers of the two phenotypes was found:</P>

<PRE>---------
Phenotype       Black         Yellow     Total
Genotype        EE+Ee          ee 
Number           182           18         200
Frequency       0.91         0.09       = 1.00
----------</PRE>

<P>The black colour type represents both homozygotes and heterozygotes. If two random black dogs are
mated, they will occasionally get yellow offspring. This happens when both dogs
by random are of the colour genotype Ee.</P>

<P>The gene counting method implies that the phenotype is equal to the genotype, but this is only the case for
yellow. For an offspring to become yellow, it should have an e gene from both its sire and dam,
each with a probability of q.
Therefore, the probability multiplication rule can be applied 
to calculate the  frequency of ee individuals which corresponds to q<SUP>2</SUP>.  From the data material it is estimated to
be 18/200 = 0.09</P>

<P>The square root of 0.09 is q = 0.30.</P>

<P>The frequency of the black gene in the population becomes p = 1 - q = 0.7.</P>
