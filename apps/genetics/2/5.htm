<H3>2.5 Gamete frequencies under linkage</H3>

<P><A HREF="4.htm">Preceding page</A> </P>

<P>The term gamete frequency is applied when the alleles from more than one locus are
considered. Every new
gamete contains an allele from each locus. Consider the two loci, A and B, the genotypes on each locus can occur in
H-W proportions, even though this is not the case for the two loci together. This can
be of&nbsp; great significance in relation to
marker genes (loci). Occasionally a specific allele on the marker loci occurs with the disease
allele of another locus. If the two loci are closely linked it could take
several generations before equilibrium is
reached between the two loci.</P>

<P>The combination of two gene pairs, A and B, each with two alleles are shown below in the classical two-by-two table,
where r, s, t, and u are the observed gamete frequencies of the gametes AB, Ab, aB and ab, see Figure 2.5.</P>

<P> </P>
<PRE>         gene A   gene B       B              b            frequency   
                 ------------------------------------------------ 
	   A	     |	r=p(A)*p(B)+D	 s=p(A)*q(b)-D  |   p(A) 	 
	   a	     |	t=q(a)*p(B)-D	 u=q(a)*q(b)+D  |   q(a)
	         -----------------------------------------------
	Frequency  | 	 p(B)		  q(b)	          |    1</PRE>

<P> Gene frequencies can be calculated by means of the gene counting method and
 they correspond to the border distributions. The
expected frequency of a gamete is the product of the border distributions 
which is equal to p(A) = r + s =
p(A)*p(B) + D + p(A)*q(b) - D = p(A)[p(B) + q(b)] = p(A). The deviation which
occurs between observed and expected numbers
is assigned the symbol D (Disequilibrium). Note that the deviations are the same size for all cells (D),
but with a negative sign for the repulsion phase gametes, Ab and aB.</P>

<P>A calculation example: The observed number of gametes is AB=21, Ab=49, aB=19, ab=11.</P>

<P> </P>
<PRE>gene A/gene B 	 	B	         b              Sum (Freq)
          ------------------------------------------------------------
    	  A	   |   21  (r=0.21)	49  (s=0.49)   |  70  (p(A)=0.7)
   	  a	   |   19  (t=0.19)	11  (u=0.11)   |  30  (q(a)=0.30)
          -------------------------------------------------------------
    Sum (Freq) |   40 (p(B)=0.4)	60  (q(b)=0.6) | 100    1

                                      
Frequencies are given within brackets:   Chi-squared  = 9.7<SUP>**</SUP> Df=1
 				      D= u-q(a)*q(b)=0.11 - 0.3*0.6= -0.07</PRE>

<P>Statistically significant deviation occurs from random combination between the genes A and B corresponding to a
disequilibrium equal to -0.07.<BR>
The corresponding gametes from the first table can be organized differently as shown below:</P>

<BR WP="BR2"><PRE>         gamete   observed frequency   expected frequency   deviation
         ------------------------------------------------------------ 
	   AB		r		  p(A)*p(B)		D
	   Ab		s		  p(A)*q(b)	       -D
	   aB		t		  q(a)*p(B)	       -D
	   ab		u		  q(a)*q(b)		D</PRE>

<P>In the table below all possible genotypes in a two gene systems are shown. Physical recombination only
has significance in the double heterozygotes, in all other genotypes a recombination would not give rise to other types of
gametes than those from which they are formed. The corresponding  genotype  frequencies under random mating are
obtained by multiplication of gamete frequencies as shown. The multiplication is done by
means of an applet designed to study linkage
and linkage disequilibrium. </P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><img src="../../genetik/2/52.gif" align=bottom > </P>

<P>Figure 2.5 shows the two types of double heterozygotes. By recombination gametes of the
other
type is formed and reverse. Therefore there is linkage equilibrium when equal numbers of the two types of double
heterozygotes occur. This can also be seen in the formula for D given below.<BR>

<BR>

<P>The expected  frequency of a specific gamete corresponds to the  frequency
where the two genes are inherited independently. In that case the multiplication rule
for probabilities can be applied to calculate the expected numbers.
The disequilibrium has the symbol D and is defined as shown above (observed - expected gamete frequency). It can
also be calculated as half of the difference between the frequencies of double heterozygotes in linkage and repulsions
phase:</P>
<PRE>        D = u  -  q(a)*q(b), or		
	D = r*u - t*s    (= [p(AB/ab) - p(Ab/aB)]/2) 
        
</PRE>

<P>The maximum disequilibrium exists when all double heterozygotes are in linkage phase (AB/ab) or
in repulsion
phase (Ab/aB); then it has the value D<SUB>Max</SUB>. </P>

<P>If the recombination frequency is c, D will be inflated to D*(1-c) per generation, so in the n'th generation D<SUB>n</SUB>
= D<SUB>0</SUB>*(1-c)<SUP>n</SUP>, where D<SUB>0</SUB> is the disequilibrium in the base population, see figure 2.6. <BR>

different recombination frequencies. </tr><tr>
 <img src="../../genetik/2/51.gif"  > </TD></TR></TABLE>

<P>For two independent loci having .5 in recombination frequency 4 to 5 generations
will pass before equilibrium is
reached. Concerning closely linked loci with less than 5 % recombination, it
will take more than 25 generations
before equilibrium is reached. </P>

<P>The release of linkage disequilibrium can produce new genetic variation for quantitative traits. If two loci are
linked, both carrying a positive and a negative effect and exist in linkage phase, new variation arises if the positive
alleles are recombined to be in linkage phase</P>

<P>Mendel's second law predicts that two loci would segregate independently in F<SUB>2</SUB> in an analysis cross. This is
caused by the
fact that all individuals in F<SUB>1</SUB> are double heterozygotes. Since only the double
heterozygotes can recombine, it will take long time before equilibrium arises in a mixed population, where the frequency of the double
heterozygotes is only  2(r*u + t*s).</P>

<P>In relation to a new mutation complete disequilibrium exists in several
future generations, as the mutation arises in only one chromosome. This disequilibrium can be used in relation to application of gene markers to identify
the localization of the gene and to identify carriers in related individuals by means of the marker
locus.</P>

<P>Within a family maximum disequilibrium always occur. This makes it possible to utilize marker genes within families. If
an individual is born with a recessive disease and   has a specific marker
combination,   new offspring having the same
marker gene combination, would with great probability also carry the disease.</P>
