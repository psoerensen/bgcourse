<H3>9.2 Effect of crossbreeding </H3>

<P><A HREF="1.htm">Preceding page</A> </P>

<P>The effect of crossbreeding is the opposite of the effect of inbreeding. 
Crosses are more heterozygotic than individuals in a pure bred population.
Contrary to inbreeding, where a linear negative relationship with fitness 
and production traits and the degree of
inbreeding, it is impossible to predict anything about the effect of
crossbreeding.</P>

<P>How is it possible to establish a sensible system of crossbreeding? The only possible method is 'the trial and error method'.
Today a large part of the practical production of poultry,
mink and pigs is based on production crosses, so the 'the trial and error method' is not
as bad as it might sound. If a combination,
showing a good crossbreeding effect or heterosis, is found, this combination can be repeated
infinitely. Apparently, a certain heterosis does not depend on the level of pure
breeding. <STRONG>Pure breeding or out breeding</STRONG> has not been defined earlier, but the words indicate that neither inbreeding nor crossbreeding
occur, therefore breeding in a
larger population of domestic animals is referred to as pure breeding or out
breeding. This definition corresponds closely to the definition of a H-W
population with less strict random mating requirements. <STRONG>Hybrid vigour</STRONG> is, as
it says, a special vigour, which occurs as a consequence of crossbreeding. Another word
used for a cross is a hybrid, which has then coined the term. Vigour is materialized in more robust animals with
larger production
capacity than pure breeds. <STRONG>Heterosis</STRONG> means the same as hybrid vigour. The word indicates that the effects are
caused by increased heterozygosity.

<P><STRONG>Systems for crossbreeding.</STRONG> Figure 9.2 shows four breeds or lines, A, B, C and D.
Crossbreeding can be carried out as two way, three way or four way crosses, backcrosses, or rotation
crosses.</P>

<P>Two way crosses - a cross between two lines A and B.</P>

<P>Back crosses - the crossed animal, AB, mated with either line A or B.</P>

<P>Three way crosses - the crossed animal, CD, is mated with a third line A.</P>

<P>Four way crosses - the crossed animal, AB, is mated with the crosses CD.</P>

<P>Rotation crossbreeding can be carried out with 3, 4 or 5 breeds or lines. In
this case 4 is used, the next breed to be used is C and then D. Normally
the females are crosses while the males are pure bred animals.<BR>
The two-way crossbreeding only gives heterosis in the offspring. To retain heterosis
in the maternal traits, three way or four-way crossing has to be applied.<BR>
Systems for crossbreeding automatically ensures as low an inbreeding as possible in the production
animals. Thus the advantage of crossing systems is that no special
action has to be taken in order to maintain minimal inbreeding.<BR>
The traits, which give largest hybrid vigour, are traits with low heritability, which implies that hybrid vigour is mostly
found in reproduction traits.</P>

<P>Figure 9.3 shows an example of hybrid vigour in mice on the number of young
a female can produce in a lifetime. The most popular system for crossbreeding
has been applied: two- and three- way crosses, and back crosses. (Data from Newman et al. J.Anim. Sci. 61 358-365, 1985).

<BR>

<P>As seen in Figure 9.3, the hybrid vigour is very high in this example as mice
of pure lines only get half the number of young that the cross bred mice get.</P>

<P>The effects can be divided into either an effect on the foetus or an effect on the mothering abilities.
The difference between the two lower curves shows the effect on the foetus,
if it is a cross or not. The lower curve represents pure bred foetuses
in pure bred mothers. The second lower curve represents a cross foetus
in a pure breed mother. The difference between the two lower curves and the two
upper ones shows the effect of a female being a&nbsp; cross or not. It is clear that most of the hybrid vigour
is in the maternal part, and it concerns the ability to ovulate a large number
of&nbsp; oocytes and hold them throughout the pregnancy.</P>

<P>The example in Figure 9.3 shows a large amount of hybrid vigour. This
is very rare, but in animal breeding it is common to see effects of
up to 10 %.<BR>
Calculation of the hybrid vigour is done as follows: (average of the crosses minus average of the pure lines) in relation to the average of the pure lines.<BR>
Example of swine: Landrace Yorkshire crosses give an extra piglet per litter compared to the pure bred sows, which
get an average litter size of 10.</P>

<P>Hybrid vigour (11-10)/10 = 0.10 or 10% for litter size in swine in the mentioned combination.</P>

<P>To carry out a cross production program it is necessary to maintain well defined lines, and that
the animals are bred in sufficiently large numbers both to
maintain them self and to produce a sufficient amount of animals to get into the
crossbreeding program. The necessary surplus of animals for breeding is not always present. This
however is
not the case in the Danish dairy breeds. Largely all females are used for
breeding, as the birth rate for the Red Danish and for the Holstein Frisian is
only slightly above two. A ratio of 1.1 to 1.2 heifer calves have to born in
order to replace their mothers, so the birth rate is just high enough to maintain the population. Rotation
crossing though can be practised outside the pure breeding kernel. The hybrid vigour is significantly
lower in rotation- than in three way crossbreeding.

<p>An extra advantage using crossing is the uniformity, which
is attained when at leas one of the parents is a pure bred animal.
 In a German investigation was found that the phenotypic variance in
back fat thickness in swine was 30 per cent lower in L x Y crosses 
than in the corresponding pure bred animals (Lutaaya et al. 2001, 79:3002-07).

<P><STRONG>Negative recombination effect in F<SUB>2</SUB></STRONG>: In the shown
crossing systems, at least one of the parent breeds was a pure bred. 
If an F<SUB>2</SUB> is produced,
this is not the
case. Production based on F<SUB>2</SUB>-animals or crossbreeding between different
 crosses  is normally a bad idea
compared to backcrosses or three way crossing. The latter has the largest heterosis effect. In F<SUB>2</SUB>s
so-called <STRONG>negative recombination effects can occur</STRONG>. This is
caused by combinations of genes, which did not exist in any of the original breeds.
For instance if a F<SUB>1</SUB>  is made by crossing aabb x AABB in F<SUB>2</SUB>
animals
of the type aaBB AAbb will occur, which were not found in any of the original
breeds. These types can be lethal, see Figure 9.4 for the biochemical pathways.
The F<SUB>2</SUB> will furthermore be more heterogenous than all other crosstypes or pure
breed animals.</P>

<P>By <STRONG>incrossing</STRONG> it is possible to improve a breed by   using a few superior animals from outside the breed. Normally animals from closely related breeds are
used because they have the desired characters to save the best of the original
breed. For this to succeed the selection must be light in the first generations of the incrossing. After incrossing
some of the recombinant types are of higher interest and it can take several generations
for them to occur<BR>

<P>Figure 9.5 shows homologous chromosomes with four gene pairs which affect a 
quantitative character. Genes can be mixed
so that it takes several generations for the desired combination, one chromosome
having all the plus signs, to occur. See also section 2.5 for linkage disequilibrium. </P>
