So far only conditions where all information can be weighted equally have been considered, as for instance a group of offspring. For a better utilization of the information it is possible to make an equation for each information and then estimate the weight factors for each information before calculating an index, this is the case in the BLUP system. 
<BR></UL><UL>
The same can be done by updating directly, but this will result in a simpler form. The updating utilizes the fact that, in principle, only three types of information of the breeding value of an animal exist – from respectively the parents, the animal itself (own) and its offspring.
</UL><UL>
The three types of indices are calculated as deviations from the population mean value.
</UL><UL>
	Information from half and full sibs are contained in the parents’ breeding values, but there is a problem: the parents’ breeding values can only be utilized once. So if one of the parents has additional offspring, the breeding value has to be re-estimated.
</UL><UL>
 	 Information from the ‘own’ records can be included as they become available, for instance at the first, the second and the third lactation. The same is true for the offspring, it can be included as it comes.
</UL><UL>
The last two conditions are responsible for the naming of the method “direct updating”</UL> </P>
