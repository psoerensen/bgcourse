A formula for breeding value estimation can be developed, this includes the extra information contributed by a gene marker. 
<BR></UL><UL>
 
</UL><UL>
The formula consists of 3 parts, which are added together. The first part is the population average. The second is the relative marker effect times 1 minus the heritability divided by 1 minus the heritability for the marker on its own. The third is the phenotype records’ deviation from the population average times the heritability minus the heritability for the marker gene divided by 1 minus the heritability for the marker.

A formula for the accuracy can also be derived. As seen, this is a function of the heritability and the heritability for the marker.
