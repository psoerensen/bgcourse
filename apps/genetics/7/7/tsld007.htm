Now some additional examples of other measurements with uniform relationship conditions, using the general formula for breeding value estimation as shown on the slide.
<BR></UL><UL>
Line 1 in the table corresponds to the formula with 0 observations, and the index is equal to the population mean with an accuracy of 0. This gives the 'basis' for evaluation of all the other indexes.Line 2 in the table corresponds to a very common situation, which is normally called a phenotype test. The animal’s breeding value is based on measurements of the animal - the equation is: I = A(bar) + h2(P -P(bar)) with a squared accuracy of h2.Line 3 shows two measurements of the animal, it could be litter size from first and second litter. The correlation between repeated measurements is called the coefficient of repeatability. This always contains some common environmental effects for the two measurements.Line 4 shows the relationship between the average of the parents and the offspring. In section 6.4 this relation was used in the estimation of the heritability. So it comes as no surprise to see the same relationship again. Line 7 shows the evaluation of a father based on an infinite number of offspring, details of this is found on the next slide.</UL> </P>
