How are the breeding value estimates calculated in practice? To make it simple we start off with one trait. The phenotypic measurements of this trait are done on either the individual or its relatives.
<BR></UL><UL>
An individual’s breeding value is calculated as the regression of the individual’s true breeding value (i.e.. genotype) on the phenotypic measurements. The breeding value, A, is equal to the regression coefficient, bA/P multiplied by the difference between the average of n measurements, Pg, and the population average, P-bar.
</UL><UL>
The regression coefficient, bA/P is by definition equal to the co-variance between the dependent variable, A (the breeding value), and the independent variable, P, and variance of the independent variable P.
</UL><UL>
The regression coefficient can also be expressed by this ratio: The number of observations, n, times the relationship coefficient, a’, times the heritability, divided by 1 plus (n-1) times the intra class correlation, t. The intra class correlation is calculated as the relationship between the individuals (observations), a, times the heritability plus the common environmental factor, c2.
