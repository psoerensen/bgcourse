Here is a simple example of how to use the derived formulas.
</UL><UL>
The index for breeding value of a bull for milk yield based is on the records of yield from 20 of its daughters. The coefficient of relationship, a’, is 0.5, and the daughters’ coefficient of relationship, a, is 0.25. The heritability of milk yield is 0.3, and the common environmental effect, c2, is 0. The average milk yield in the population is 7000 kg. 
</UL><UL>
The daughters have an average yield of 7500 kg, that is a deviation of 500 kg. from the population average.
</UL><UL>
The index for the bull is as follows: 20 daughters times a heritability of 0.3 times the relationship coefficient of 0.5 divided by 1 plus 19 times 0.3 times the relationship between the daughters, 0.25. All this multiplied by the deviation of 500 kg., and added the population average of 7000 kg. to obtain the absolute breeding value of 7618 kg. 
</UL><UL>
The squared accuracy, r2AI is 0.618. 
</UL><UL>
By means of the general formula for breeding value estimation many special cases can de derived. Most interesting is the fact that in the calculation of breeding value from a record of the animal itself, both the regression coefficient and the squared accuracy is equal to the heritability.
