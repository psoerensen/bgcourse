Breeding value calculation based on half sib offspring corresponds to the definition of breeding value, and from an infinite number of offspring gives the weight factor 2 and accuracy 1, independent of the size of the heritability. This is the best information source when having  low heritability and a large number of offspring.
</UL><UL>
By breeding value estimation based on full sibs, the figure shows that a father, a mother or a full sib get the same breeding value estimate and the same accuracy. The maximum accuracy is in this case 0.5, even if there is an infinite number of offspring.</UL> </P>
