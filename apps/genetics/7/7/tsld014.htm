	Now a practical example: how does the effect of using a gene marker on the accuracy by breeding value estimation depend on the size of the heritability. In the three examples the gene marker has a 20 % share of the heritability.
<BR></UL><UL>
	First a trait with a low heritability of 0.05 (column 1 in the slide). The heritability for the marker is 0.01. By inserting the numbers into the formula for accuracy, the accuracy squared is increased from 0.05 to 0.24.
</UL><UL>
	 Secondly a trait with a medium heritability of 0.25. Thus the improvement of the accuracy squared by use of the marker is less, from 0.25 to 0.35. 
</UL><UL>
	For a trait with a high heritability of 0.5, the improvement is even smaller. The accuracy squared has increased from 0.5 to 0.56. 
</UL><UL>
	The conclusion must be that a gene marker is more significant for traits with low heritability. Therefore it is clear that testing for gene markers for disease resistance should have a high priority, as disease traits typically have low heritability. In chapter 12 the use of gene markers will be discussed more detailed.
