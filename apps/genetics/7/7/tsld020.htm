Normally, the calculated breeding values are expressed in absolute units. For instance, the breeding value for a bull’s daily weight gain from birth to 1. year is 1100 gram/day.

A lot of people have difficulties evaluating whether this is good or bad, as they lack the average with which to compare. Therefore is it common to calculate the breeding values on the basis of the population average. Thus reaching a relative measure for the breeding value in comparison to the population average. If the population average is, for instance, 1000 g. in growth per day, the relative growth in this example would be 100 g. This corresponds to a relative breeding value of ca. 50 g. per day on average for the individual’s offspring. Further more, the breeding value can be standardized by dividing it by the population standard deviation. The standardized breeding values are now normally distributed with the mean value 0 and a standard deviation of 1.

	To complicate things, different countries have different ways presenting the breeding values. In Denmark we use index. The indecies are standardized breeding values, which are multiplied by a desired standard error of 5 and added to a desired mean value, most often at 100. Thus an animal with an index of 100 corresponds to an average animal for the trait in question.

	The breeding value of an animal is not constant. Not only new records can change the breeding value estimate, but typically also the population average will change due to selection. When the average of all breeding values must be 100 in every calculation, thus a specific animal breeding value will decrease in each calculation, as the average of the population’s absolute breeding value increases due to selection. Contrary to Denmark, some countries choose to have a permanent base due to this phenomenon, in order to keep the population average from changing. This is the case in North America.
