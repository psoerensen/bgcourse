This slide shows the accuracy of breeding value estimation based on offspring, as function of the number of offspring. As can be seen, the accuracy increases when the number of offspring increases. When there is a great number of offspring, the curve flattens when approaching one. 
<BR></UL><UL>
Furthermore, the slide shows that the accuracy depends on the heritability of the trait. The higher the heritability, the higher the accuracy. 
</UL><UL>
This means, that for traits with a heritability of 0.5, the estimate is as good as it can be for 50 offspring. When the trait, on the contrary, has really low heritability, the accuracy still improves when having as much as 1000 offspring.</UL> </P>
