<H3>7.1 Estimation of breeding values, general</H3>

<P><A HREF="0.htm">Chapter 7</A> </P>

<P>In a large randomly mated population, each individual should on average give
birth to two offspring in order to maintain the size of the population. The distribution of
the number of
offspring in the population has a left skewed binominal distribution (Poisson distributed) with
a average value of 2 and variance of 2. Which means that the number of offspring
per individual can vary from 0 and upwards, the values 0,1,2,3,4 and 5 being the most
frequent. The exact breeding value, based on
the definition given in chapter 6, cannot be calculated in such a population
because of the small number of offspring. An estimation is all we can get.</P>

<P>An estimated breeding value is often called an index (I). The index can be estimated
on the basis of information of phenotype values from all possible relatives. A simple regression line or multiple
regression can be used. The higher the number of relatives is the better the
estimation will be. Correlation between the true
breeding value (A) and the index is given the name <STRONG>Accuracy</STRONG> and it has the symbol r<SUB>AI</SUB>. </P>

<P>The estimated breeding value is based on a theory of&nbsp; linear regression and correlation. The
basic definition of these terms can be seen <A HREF="../../genetik/applets/stat.htm">here</A>, or
more detailed
in statistical textbooks.</P>
