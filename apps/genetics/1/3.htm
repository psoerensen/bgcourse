<H3>1.3 The terms phenotype, genotype and heritability</H3>

<P><A HREF="2.htm">Preceding page</A> </P>

<P>Most quantitative traits exhibit some degree of heritability. The heritability 
is evident when individuals, deviating
positively or negatively from the average, also become 
offspring with deviation in the same trait in the same direction as their
parents. There is a continuum of some traits, which is inherited with a simple Mendelian form and
other traits with quantitative
genetic inheritance without separate classes. The quantitative genetic 
inheritance is caused by the effect of many different genes, each with minor
effect. The traits are also under the influence of  environmental
effects.</P>

<P>The similarity between related individuals is determined by the degree of heritability. The degree of heritability can be
estimated statistically as a regression of offspring on average parents. The degree of heritability has values
between 0 and 1. The degree of heritability at 0 corresponds to no similarity, and 1 corresponds to the highest
possible similarity between parent and offspring. See right side of Figure 1.4.<BR>

<P>The upper part of Figure 1.4 gives the relation formula for a trait or the entire individual the <STRONG>Genotype</STRONG> (all genes
inherited from the parents) and <STRONG>the phenotype</STRONG> (appearance or what can be measured
in the individual). The
deviations of the phenotype from the genotype are caused by&nbsp; random environmental effects. The formulation was made
by the geneticist Wilhelm Johannesen, employed by this university around year 1900. The formula was based on
the size of bean
seeds derived from beans with varying degrees of inbreeding.</P>

<P>Figure 1.4 shows what Johannesen discovered: When the beans were 100 %
inbred, which means that all beans
were genetically similar, there was no relation between the weight of the parent bean and
that of its offspring, i.e. the
regression coefficient (b) of offspring on parents equaled 0. For outbred beans being genetically
different, there
was a linear regression of b = 0.27. Which means that if a bean was 10 mg larger
than average then the offspring was 2,7 mg larger than average.</P>

Figure 1.5<BR>
Relationship between the height of&nbsp; parent and offspring&nbsp; (vet.
    students). If the average height of the parents is 1 cm above the average, their offspring is 0.6
    above the average. The
relationship is caused by the fact that height, as a trait,&nbsp; is passed down
    with
a heritability of 60 %. The symbol 1 is the boys and 2 is the girls. 
<br><img src="../../genetik/1/2-1.gif" ></TD></TR></TABLE>
<BR>For most traits in outbred populations there will be some similarities between related
individuals. Figure 1.5 shows the twodimensional relationship between the average height&nbsp;of the vet. students and that of their parents. The figure
is a printout from the SAS system by use of the procedure proc plot.<BR>


<P>Figure 1.5 shows that there is a strong relationship between the height of
the parent and that of their offspring. The
relationship equals a degree of heritability of 60 % for the trait height in the human population, cf.  the
slope of the regression line which is b = 0.6.</P>

<P>The <STRONG>Genotype</STRONG> can only be observed when genetic variation
occurs. This variation&nbsp; is equal to the part of the
phenotype (the phenotypic variation) which can be passed down to the offspring (genotypic
variation). The genotype
constitutes respectively&nbsp; 27 % of the phenotypic variation for bean weight and
60% of human height. The
environmental effects   thus 
contribute to the  rest of the variation. That is (100-27)= 73 % for bean weight
 and (100-60) = 40 % of the phenotypic variation for human height.
