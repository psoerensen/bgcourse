<p>This chapter is meant as a brushup  for terms
such as genotype, phenotype and linear regression, as well as the introduction of
new ones. This is only meant as an overview,
so very  detailed study should be avoided, as some of the terms 
are fairly abstract. After reading of chapters 2 to 8 read this chapter again.
