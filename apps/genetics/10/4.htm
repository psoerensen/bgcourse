<H3>10.4 Identification of chromosomes by means of chromosome paint </H3>

<P><A HREF="3.htm">Preceding page</A> </P>

<P>Figure 10.7 shows paint on swine chromosomes with a DNA probe, derived from a hamster cell line which contains the p-arm of swine chromosome 12.
Two chromosome arms, which are identical to the two homologue chromosomes are
painted.&nbsp;

<P>The paint method is summarized in the following. It is also called 'Fluorescence in situ
hybridisation', FISH:</P>

<UL>
  <LI>Labeling of the probe with biotinylated nucleotides</LI>
  <LI>Melting of the probe and target-DNA (chromosome slides)</LI>
  <LI>Hybridisation of the probe and target-DNA under glass cover for several days</LI>
  <LI>Washing to get rid of non-bound probe</LI>
  <LI>A layer of avidin (binds strongly to biotin) </LI>
  <LI>Staining by means of fluorescence labeled antibodies against avidin</LI>
  <LI>Photographing by means of a fluorescence microscope</LI>
</UL>

<P>When paints with smaller pieces of DNA, for instance a 40-kb large, (inserted
into a cosmid) very distinct results occur in the form of two dots, one on each of the
two chromatids on the two homologous chromosomes, <A HREF="../../mink/insitug.htm">see here</A>. </P>

<P>All human chromosomes are sorted so it is possible to buy pure DNA from
every single chromosome. When each of them are labelled with different
colours, the chromosome pairs also get a distinct colour of paint. This technique makes it
simple to identify the chromosomes which are involved in complex
translocation. <A HREF="paint.htm">Link </A>to see paints of all human chromosomes.</P>

<P>By means of chromosome paint the homology between species can also be identified, see Figure 10.8 with mink chromosomes
(left). The same
chromosomes (right) are in situ hybridised (painted) with a human chromosome 14 probe. A table
showing the homology between the chromosomes in four
domestic species of animals can be seen <A HREF="../../mink/zoofish/homoprt.htm"> here.</A>
