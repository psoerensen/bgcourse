<H3>10.3 Chromosome aberrations in domestic animals</H3>

<P><A HREF="2.htm">Preceding page</A> </P>

<P>If an individual does not have a balanced set of chromosomes, i.e. two
homologue chromosomes in each pair (and for the male an X and a Y), 
this will normally be visible in the phenotype,
which then shows more or less deviation from normality. Animals with a non-balanced 
set of chromosomes
will most often be sterile and have low vitality.
Animals with a balanced set of chromosomes will generally be normal phenotypically. Chromosome deviations, in animals with a normal phenotype, are
normally detected due to low fertility or complete sterility. The karyotype
of a bull with low fertility having a 1/8 translocation is shown
in Figure 10.2, cf. Christensen, K., Agerholm, J.S. &amp; Larsen, B. 1992a. <i> Dairy breed bull with complex chromosome translocation: Fertility and linkage
studies</i>. Hereditas 117, 199-202.

<BR>

<P>Other types of chromosome deviations worth mentioning are trisomies, the best
known case being trisomy 21 in human. It occurs in about one in 500 new born
babies.<BR>
The trisomies are very rare in animals, but they occasionally occur. 
Below is shown a trisomy 28 in cattle. The animal suffered from cleft 
palate and heart abnormalities, see
Figure 10.3.

<P>Normally the foetuses carrying trisomy 28 are aborted or die
straight after birth.</P>

<P>In most domestic animals less severe chromosome errors occur. For instance fusion of two acrocentric
chromosomes, called centric fusion.<BR>
<STRONG>The best known is the 1/29 centromere fusion of chromosome 1 and 29 in cattle</STRONG>. When such a fusion occurs in
heterozygote form, it causes a slightly lower fertility of about 10 %, when measured as
return to the service rate.</P>

<P><STRONG>A corresponding centromere fusion is found in the blue foxes</STRONG>. 
Here the effect is of the same
magnitude concerning litter size, see table below where
the chromosome number 49 corresponds to heterozygotes with respect to the centromere fusion. Data from Christensen et al. Hereditas 1982, 97:211-215.</P>

<P>Metaphase chromosomes of the three types are shown in Figure 10.4. In the figure
there is a circle around the chromosomes that participate in the
centromere fusion.

<P>It is known that some mice carry up to seven sets of centromere fusions. When all
fusions occur in heterozygote form these mice have a very low fertility, consistent with a reduction in fertility of about 10
% per centromere fusion in the heterozygote stage.</P>

</TABLE>
<b>Imprinting:</b> There exist centromere fusions  involving all the  20 pairs of the
 acrocentric mouse chromosomes. 
If two animals heterozygotic for a centromere fusion are mated spontaneously there will occur
 offspring having received
two chromosome of a pair from one parent and zero from the other, see Figure 10.4a.
Such an individual has a balanced 
set of chromosomes, but is not necessarily normal. About half of the mouse chromosomes
give rise to abnormalities when uniparental disomy occurs
as there has to be one maternal and one paternal chromosome in a pair for normal development.
This phenomenon is due to imprinting (which genes being on/off is depending if the chromosome comes from the 
sire or the dam).
 Imprinting is important to understand why cloning of adult cells give many
difficulties. 
 Incorrect maternal or paternal imprinting disturb the ratio between the development of the
placenta and the foetus
which often cause early embryonic morality and other developmental errors. 



<P><STRONG>Free martins:</STRONG> Chromosome investigations can be used to 
identify animals with placental anastomoses, which often occur in cattle twins. When mixing the
blood in the early foetal stages, a mixture of stem cells are established for the white and
the red blood cells. The proportions are from 0 to 100 % of
the right 'type'. If the mixing is too extensive the heifer in a mixed twin pair gets abnormal sexual organs and
is infertile. The bull calf has normal
fertility, but in paternity testing by means of a blood sample mistakes can occur, as
this might show the genotype of the other twin. 
Therefore, when delivering blood samples for a paternity tests information 
should be given, if one of
the involved animals have a twin.

<P><STRONG>Sex-chromosome errors in mares</STRONG>: Mares with XY sex-chromosomes are fairly common in some of the half-breeds.
They are not fertile. There also occur a fair number of mares with XO or XXX sex-chromosome
constellations. Figure 10.5 shows chromosomes of a mare with an abnormal X
chromosome, which is always inactive. It has two q-arms. The picture is provided by I. Gustavsson, The Swedish Agricultural University.</P>

<P><STRONG>Sister chromatid exchange (SCE)</STRONG> <BR>
Cells which are grown for two cycles, BrdU being added in the first cycle, can reveal SCE. SCE can identify individuals with unstable chromosomes or be utilized
for a mutagenity test. The number of SCE is proportional to the doses of the mutagene. Below are shown mink chromosomes
carrying SCE. The SCE
chromosome is also called Harlequin chromosome. The chromosomes, without occurance
of SCE, show no breaks in the chromosome, i.e. it has two unbroken strings, one light and
one darkly stained. Where SCE occurs the chromatids change their colour. For SCE
to occur both strings of the DNA must have been broken to joint up
with the opposite string.<BR>
