<H3>8.1 Difference of and intensity of selection</H3>

<TABLE BORDER="0"  width="50%" align="right">
<TR><TD>Figure 8.1. Shows a graphic interpretation of the selection difference 
    (S), the
selection intensity (i) and selection response (delta G) by use of individual
    selection.

<P>Figure 8.1 shows a normal distribution of a quantitative trait. A limit of
the selection can be defined according to the proportion being used for breeding.<BR>
S designates the difference between the population average and the mean value of the selected animals. If a specific group has been selected,
its actual mean
value is calculated and then S can be calculated. When a certain proportion of animals
is used in breeding, the standardized difference in the selection can 
be seen in a table when using truncation selection. 
This difference is called
<STRONG>selection intensity</STRONG>, as shown
in Figure 8.1, it can be estimated as S/sigma<SUB>P</SUB>, sigma<SUB>P</SUB>
being the phenotypic standard deviation.<P>Figure 8.1 also shows the connection between
estimated breeding value and the simple formula for selection response R = h<SUP>2</SUP> * S, given in
section 6.4, and its relation to the estimation of breeding value by means of
its own phenotype, cf. section 7.2.</P>

<P>Below is a table of 'i' calculated on the basis of the proportion of animals selected for breeding.</P>
