<h3>6.4 Calculation of the heritability by statistical analysis </h3>

<p> Material for calculation of heritability for stature height in man are shown in the following.
<p> The heritability can be calculated from the
linear  relationship between parent and offspring both as correlation and regression. 
<p> The average parent height are also used, for a  
 material from veterinary students in 1996 <A HREF = "../1/vet96.htm">click here</A>. 
<p> To see the data and the utilized SAS program for  the 1997 material
<A HREF = "../1/student.htm">click here</A> and the results for 1997
<A HREF = "../1/vet97.htm">click here</A>. 
<p> Would you run your own analysis; transfer  the program and data via the clip board to SAS.

This can be done by pulling the  mouse over both program and data to defined a block. 
When you have defined the block go to the edit area and chose copy. Thereafter, when you have opened SAS
utilize paste in the edit area.

<p> Some other pairs of  small examples  on utilization of the analyses of variance for calculation  
of repeatability for mink litter size and heritability for body length in swine can be seen.
The SAS Programs for the mink material <A HREF = "mink-rep.htm"> click here</A>
and for pig material <A HREF = "gris-sib.htm"> click here</A>
Use the clip board as explained above.

<p> Finally a very large data set from pigs with more measurements
(daily gain, fodder consumption and meat per cent) sub divided in full and half sib 
progeny groups is
 precented <A HREF = "full-sib.htm">here </A>
